# Howdy and welcome to Darrian's page!

Get to learn a little bit about me!

## About Me

Howdy, my name is Darrian Hunter. I am from a small town called Coleman, Tx and I love sports, gaming and working out. I am a Technology Management major here at Texas A&M and I am class of 2021. Growing up in a small town allowed me to compete in whatever sport interested me. Throughout my years in Coleman I played Football, Basketball, Baseball, Tennis, Cross Coountry and Track. My favorite sports to compete in were Football and Basketball because it allowed me to achieve a goal by working with my friends/teammates. I have always been competitive at everything I do and always give it my 110%. Not only did I compete in sports but I also compete in games. I play various games like Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Warzone, Rogue Company, Fortnite, and recently Marvel's Avenger's. When I compete in cash tournaments I usually stream live on Twitch, so click the link, checkout my stream and leave hit that follow button while you're at it!
