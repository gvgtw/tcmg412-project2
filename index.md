## Welcome to TCMG 412 Group 3's Page

This is a brief webiste to tell you about us or random things we find interesting.

### Corbin Cabrera

I am a senior Technology Management major at Texas A&M University. I was born in Wurtzburg, Germany and have 3 cats and 3 dogs. I love tattoos and have a shoulder piece along with a half sleeve on my left arm. I will be getting some more soon. The inkmasters event is normally at the Brazos Center the first weekend of Feburary and I hope COVID doesn't cancel that as well. Ultimately, whatever is safer is fine, but tattoo fever is definitely a thing. I love to read and play games. Video game, board games, you name it, I will probably enjoy it. Michael Crichton is one of my favorite authors at the moment. Jurrassic Park is one of my favorite movies along with pretty much anything marvel related.
