### Howdy!!

## Diana Parra

I am a senior studying Technical Management at TAMU. I was born and raised in Laredo, Tx. I have a puppy named Max and a hamster named AJ. My hobbies include being handy, grilling, playing video games, and traveling. At the beginning of the year I got the chance to visit Colorado and Disney World with my girlfriend. This was before COVID got out of hand in the U.S. Traveling is one of my favorite things to do, and I am looking forward going to California whenever things start looking better.
