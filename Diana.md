### Howdy!!

## Diana Parra

I am a senior studying Technical Management at TAMU. I was born and raised in Laredo, Tx. I have a puppy named Max and a hamster named AJ. My hobbies include being handy, grilling, playing video games, and traveling. At the beginning of the year, I got the chance to visit Colorado and Disney World with my girlfriend. This was before COVID got out of hand in the U.S. Traveling is one of my favorite things to do, and I am looking forward to going to California whenever things start looking better.

My favorite game at the moment is Apex Legends, and I currently play on Xbox. My all-time favorite video game is Bully: Scholarship Edition. Besides playing video games, I like to work on side projects. My latest project was working with Raspberry Pi. I found repo on Github that plays music with RFID cards that integrate with Spotify.
