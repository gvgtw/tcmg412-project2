## Howdy! Welcome to Liliana's Page!
I am a Senior Technology Management major, with a minor in Business and Cybersecurity. 
I was born and raised in Houston, Texas. 

### Hobbies
I like to be crafty and work with my hands. I received my cosmetology license in high school and really enjoy cutting hair.
During my free time, I like to paint on small canvases and make earrings out of resin. 


### Currently
I am currently working on two certifications.
I am studying ITIL 4 in my capstone class and the EC Council Computer Hacking Forensic Investigator (CHFI) through TAMU Cybersecurity Center.
