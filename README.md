 In order to add files to your page you need to do the following:
 1. First add your image or images you want to use on your webpage in the "images" folder
 
 2. Once you have done that add your images file name exactly how it is to the end of this link: https://gvgtw.github.io/tcmg412-project2/images/
 Example: If my image file name was "Cat 5.jpg" I would put https://gvgtw.github.io/tcmg412-project2/images/Cat 5.jpg
 
 3. If that works correctly it should bring you to a page with the image you put at the end of the link.
 
 4. Copy that link and put it on your webpage by using the markdown method ![image](link you copied)
    or you can use the HTML version like I did in order to resize the picture to your liking.
    
 5. To see the HTML code for resizing, look at my code on Darrian's.md
