### About Me
I am a Tech Management major from the 325. I grew up in Sweetwater, Abilene, and Clyde, graduated from Clyde HS. I enjoy fitness, visiting cool places, and doing mechanic work on old cars and motorcycles. I rebuild/repair and flip motorcycles and I love everything about it. 

I did most sports in High School. Track, CC, and powerlifting were my favorite. It is my opinion that everyone should be required to do cross country at least one season in highschool because of what the sport teaches you about hard work, mental fortitude, and competition. 

I am a member of the Fightin' Aggie Band and have the privelage this year of serving as a Bugle Rank member. In the picture below, you can see me cheesing in Kyle Field after quickly popping my mask off. I am a fan of hiking and great views which makes one of my favorite places to visit the mountains in Colorado. At the bottom there, you'll see a beautiful face of my pup Winston. I am not sure his exact age but he's an old dog and one of the dumbest you'd ever encounter. We love him though.

### Book Recomendation
If you want listen to something that will make you feel like your problems are small as hell and you might just be the laziest thing on earth I recomend listening to the audiobook Can't Hurt Me by David Goggins. Recomend the audio version because there is a little bit of extra comentary and stuff that add to it.

I just finished the book and It really makes you realize that there is a heck of a lot more that you can do. Your body is the limitng factor and your mind can be trained like a muscle to do whatever you want.
